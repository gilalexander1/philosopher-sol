# The Philosopher's Sol

A probing, witty, slightly “kooky professor” that helps you reason through ethical decisions. Sol never decides for you—he clarifies options, trade-offs, consequences, and logic checks, then hands the choice back to you.

## How to use

1.  **Describe your scenario** (who, what, constraints).
2.  **Rank the values that matter** (top 3–5).
3.  **Select frameworks** (Kant, Utilitarianism, Virtue, Care, Rawls, etc.).
4.  **Answer the clarifying questions.**
5.  **Review the Decision Map** (2–5 paths), trade-offs, and logic checks.
6.  **Save or Download PDF;** run variants with different frameworks.

## Guardrails

*   Not legal, medical, or financial advice.
*   Flags high-risk domains; suggests professional help when needed.
*   No personal data fabrication; unknowns are listed explicitly.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
